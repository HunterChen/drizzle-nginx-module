Name
    drizzle-nginx-module - libdrizzle upstream module for nginx

Description
    This is an nginx module integrating libdrizzle
    (https://launchpad.net/libdrizzle) into nginx in an
    non-blocking and streamming way.

    Essentially it provides a very efficient and flexible way
    for nginx internals to access mysql, drizzle, sqlite3,
    as well as other RDBMS's that support the drizzle protocol
    or mysql protocol. Also it can serve as a direct REST
    interface to those RDBMS backends.

    Currently it's not in the form of a standard nginx upstream
    module, but fiddling with nginx's connection/event API
    directly. This will change in the next few days or so.

    After this stuff becomes a real upstream module, we can
    take full advantage of the per-worker connection pool
    mechanism provided by Maxim Dounin's ngx_upstream_keepalive
    module:

        http://mdounin.ru/hg/ngx_http_upstream_keepalive/

Synopsis

    # POST /mysql
    # select * from my_table;
    location /mysql {
        drizzle;
        drizzle_host localhost;
        drizzle_user db_user;
        drizzle_pass db_password;
        drizzle_db   db_name;
        drizzle_sql  $request_body;
    }

Status
    This module is NOT working yet but we're working hard
    on it ;)

Installation
    You should first install libdrizzle which can be obtained
    from here:

        https://launchpad.net/libdrizzle

    Grab the nginx source code from nginx.net (<http://nginx.net/>), for
    example, the version 0.8.29 (see nginx compatibility), and then build
    the source with this module:

        $ wget 'http://sysoev.ru/nginx/nginx-0.8.29.tar.gz'
        $ tar -xzvf nginx-0.8.29.tar.gz
        $ cd nginx-0.8.29/

        # Here we assume you would install you nginx under /opt/nginx/.
        $ ./configure --prefix=/opt/nginx \
            --add-module=/path/to/drizzle-nginx-module

        $ make -j2
        $ make install

    Download the latest version of the release tarball of this module from
    drizzle-nginx-module file list
    (<http://github.com/agentzh/drizzle-nginx-module/downloads>).

Compatibility
    The following versions of Nginx should work with this module:

    *   0.8.x (last tested version is 0.8.29)

    *   0.7.x >= 0.7.44 (last tested version is 0.7.64)

    Earlier versions of Nginx like 0.6.x and 0.5.x will *not* work.

    If you find that any particular version of Nginx above 0.7.21 does not
    work with this module, please consider reporting a bug.
